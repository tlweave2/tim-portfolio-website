            <h2>Computer Science Student & Former Entrepreneur</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Timothy Weaver, a passionate computer science student with a unique background in entrepreneurship. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Arizona State University.</p>

            <p>My journey is a bit unconventional - before diving into the world of code, I spent nearly two decades as the proud owner of Strokers, a successful motorcycle shop in Merced, CA. This experience wasn't just about bikes; it was a crash course in entrepreneurship, leadership, and problem-solving.</p>

            <h3>From Wrenches to Keyboards</h3>
            <p>The transition from motorcycles to computer science might seem unexpected, but for me, it was a natural progression. Both fields require analytical thinking, attention to detail, and a passion for building and fixing things. The thrill of solving complex problems and creating something from scratch – whether it's a custom bike or a new application – drives me every day.</p>

            <p>My academic journey is equipping me with core programming principles, computer systems fundamentals, algorithms, data structures, and software development methodologies. But it's my real-world experience that sets me apart. I've honed my abilities in inventory management, customer service, financial planning, marketing, and team leadership - all skills that translate beautifully into the tech world.</p>

            <h3>Beyond the Screen</h3>
            <p>When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hitting the trails</li>
                <li>Planning my next travel adventure</li>
                <li>Tinkering with personal coding projects</li>
                <li>Enjoying a good cup of coffee while brainstorming new ideas</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm a strong advocate for teamwork and collaboration. I believe effective communication and a collaborative spirit are key to achieving success in any project. As a lifelong learner, I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and skillset within the software engineering domain.</p>

            <p>I'm excited to bring my unique blend of entrepreneurial spirit and technical skills to the world of computer science and software development. Let's connect and create something amazing together!</p>
